                <div class="details">
                    <h2>The Ghana Cashew</h2>
                    <p>Cashews are actually the kidney-shaped seeds that adhere to the bottom of the
                        cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree.</p>
                    <p>In Ghana, mature cashew trees normally start flowering in late November to
                        December. The fruit matures in 90 to 100 days after flowering. The ripe fruits
                        normally start to drop in late January. The peak fruit collection period is
                        between February and March, with a few late-maturing trees dropping their fruits
                        in April. Brazilian, Tanzania, and Benin are the cashew nuts varieties grown in
                        Ghana.</p>
                    <p>Ghana cashew nuts are some of the most nutritious nuts on our planet. Cashew
                        nuts contain unsaturated fat, iron, proteins, iron, calcium, among other
                        minerals and nutrients.</p>
                    <p>Cashew nuts in Ghana are mostly produced by small scale farmers representing
                        about 85% of the total production. It is estimated that over 70,000 hectares of
                        land in Ghana is used to grow cashew nuts. Some of the cashew nuts growing areas
                        include; Ahafo and Bono areas.</p>
                    <p>Statistics show that Ghana produced north of 80,000 tons of cashew nuts in
                        the previous year. This ranks cashew nuts as one of the top export commodities
                        in Ghana in terms of value. Almost all of Ghana's cashew nuts are exported raw.</p>
                    <p>The global cashew industry has grown rapidly over the last decade, driven by
                        increasing consumption of cashew nuts around the world. And the market for raw
                        cashews is forecast to continue growing at an annual rate of 4.27% between 2020
                        and 2025. It is expected to reach almost US$7 billion by 2025.</p>
                    <p>The growing demand for cashew nuts around the world, particularly in
                        developed and emerging economies, is driven by a number of factors. They include
                        recognition of their health and nutritional benefits and the growth in plant
                        based diets. Cashew nuts are also considered a substitute for dairy products and
                        they represent a popular savoury snack. They are also a substitute for the ever
                        popular peanut butter.</p>
                    <p>African countries are at the forefront in responding to this growing demand.
                        They have increased production.</p>
                    <p>Demonstrating this, the African continent now accounts for over 50% of raw
                        cashew nut. About 90% of all Africa’s production is exported, mainly to Vietnam
                        and India. These two countries account for 98% of the world’s raw cashew nut
                        imports. Vietnam and India deshell and process cashews before reexporting them
                        to the US, Europe, the Middle East, China and Australia, where they are in turn
                        roasted, salted and packaged prior to consumption.</p>
